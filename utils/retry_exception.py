    Retry decorator with exponential backoff on exception.

    Args:
        max_attempts (int, optional): The maximum number of retry attempts (default is 3).
        initial_delay (float, optional): The initial delay in seconds between retries (default is 3).
        backoff_factor (float, optional): The factor by which the delay should lengthen after each failure (default is 2).

    Raises:

    Returns:
        callable: A decorator that can be applied to functions.
